# Portfolio
- ü§ñ [Tic-Tac-Toe with Artifical Intelligence](https://github.com/rachyoder/tic-tac-toe-app)
    - An early project I made when learning how to code, this recreates the *Machine Educable Noughts and Crosses Engine (MENACE)* to teach the program how to play against you over several games using a reinforcement loop. Using a reward/punishment system for wins and losses, *MENACE* is able to strategize the best way to win a game of tic-tac-toe.
